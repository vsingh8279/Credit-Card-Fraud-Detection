The GitHub link mentioned in my resume for the Yogasana Recommendation Project was incorrect. It pointed to a different project (Credit Card Detection).

This is the actual repository 
for the Yogasana Recommendation Project, and it contains all the relevant code and documentation. I apologize for any confusion caused.

Feel free to explore the project details below and reach out for any further clarifications!
